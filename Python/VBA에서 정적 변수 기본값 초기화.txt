One way to do this if you want to keep the static semantics and not switch to a global is to sniff the default value and then set the initial condition:

Static i As Integer
if (i = 0) then i = 5
Safer alternative would perhaps be

Static i As Variant
if isempty(i) then i = 5
Or

Public Sub foo(optional init as boolean = false)
    Static i As Integer
    if init then
      i = 5
      exit sub
    endif
You could probably also create a class with a default property and use class_initialize but that's probably a bit over-fussy.
